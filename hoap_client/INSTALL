Hoap_client - Client comm module for HOAP-3

Installation from CMake (Multiplatform)
---------------------------------------

Navigate to the project. An out-of-source build is recommended however not mandatory. To do this, create and enter a 'build' directory. 'cmake ..' should create a 'Makefile' or '.sln' there. A 'make' or 'build' should make output 'Hoap_client' appear in ./out/ correspondent directory.
